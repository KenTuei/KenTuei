# Hi, I'm Ken Tuei 👋  

### Software Engineer | Backend-Focused Full-Stack Developer | Systems Builder  

I design and build secure, scalable software systems that solve real-world problems.

With a strong foundation in both Business and Technology, I approach software engineering beyond just writing code — I think in terms of architecture, performance, maintainability, and product impact.

I am passionate about building technology that empowers users, strengthens digital ecosystems, and scales reliably in production environments.

## 🧠 Developer Philosophy

I believe great software is:

- Secure by design  
- Structured for scale  
- Clean and maintainable  
- Performance-aware  
- Business-aligned  

I don’t just build features — I design systems.
